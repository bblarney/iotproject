C++ Point of Sale Project

1. This was a school project for a 3rd semester C++ class. It was created in a series of 5 'Milestones'.

2. The task for this project was to create an application that managed an 'assembly line' of orders, items, and tasks.
The first thing that was created was a CSV reader to read in customer order information. Then item manager, order manager, 
and task manager classes were implemented to manage 'items', 'orders', and 'tasks'. 
An order would consist of items, and tasks would be preformed to make sure those items were ready to fill the order.
The finished program would read in customer orders and fulfill them automatically in a way similar to an assembly line.

3. This project allowed me to practise using Object Oriented Programming techniques to divide a larger program into more manageable parts.
It also taught me to create a simple CSV reader application which can be extremely useful in many different projects.
